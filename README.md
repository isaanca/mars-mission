# mars-mission

Intermediate-level Python 3 learning project about object-oriented programming.

In this challenge, we are making a basic version of the game Lunar Lander while learning how to use outside code in the form of libraries, and how to use object oriented programming.

## Difficulty Level:  INTERMEDIATE

To understand and complete this challenge, you should have a basic understanding of computer programming principles in Python, including how to use variables, lists, loops, conditionals, and print statements. You will also need to know how to use the command line so that you can open, save, and manage files.

## The Story

Your challenge is to build a spaceship and land it on Mars, using object-oriented programming and the `Tkinter` library. NASA has chosen you to be the first animal to ever do this, but it has proven to be more difficult than you think. You decide to practice using Python, so that you can understand the necessary speed to land your spaceship safely. 

## What you will learn

In this project, you will learn about:
* Object-oriented programming
* `Tkinter` graphics library
